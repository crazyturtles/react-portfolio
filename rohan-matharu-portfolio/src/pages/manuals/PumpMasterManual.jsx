						<h2>What is PumpMaster V3</h2>
						<p>
							PumpMaster is a web application that aims to help a Concrete
							Pumping company with daily operations. The PumpMaster V3 is an
							upgrade from the PumpMasterV2; the new application still retains
							the robust functionality of its predecessor, from maintaining all
							data essential to the end user's daily operation to creating,
							scheduling, and assigning a job. With a newer and a more
							user-friendly user interface, the PumpMasterV3 application aims to
							make the work of the end user a lot more efficient and that will
							directly translate to the company's success.
